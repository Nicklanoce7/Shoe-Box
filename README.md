## Problem Description
We are tasked with developing a regional database that effectively organizes the complex dynamics of a professional sports team. The core entity is the ‘Team’, which represents the organization around which all activities, including player management, match scheduling, and fan interactions revolve. Key components include maintaining detailed records of players, their engagements, game statistics, training sessions, and youth player progress. The database must be capable of reflecting real-life associations, such as which players are part of which teams, the historical performance in matches, and fan purchases. We aim to create sample data that will populate the database and replicate a realistic operational scenario. By performing various queries on this data, the database should provide in insights into team performance, fan engagement, and financial health, thereby supporting strategic business decisions for the sports organization.
